This guide provides strategies for implementing successful referral and affiliate programs for ecommerce businesses using RefRef.

## Why Referrals Work for Ecommerce

Ecommerce businesses benefit from referral programs in several key ways:

- Lower customer acquisition costs compared to paid advertising
- Higher average order values from referred customers
- Increased trust and conversion rates through social proof
- Enhanced customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior
- Expanded reach into new customer segments

## Designing Your Ecommerce Referral Program

### Key Design Considerations

- **Incentive Type** - Discounts, store credit, free products, or cash rewards
- **Incentive Value** - Finding the right balance between appeal and profitability
- **Reward Structure** - One-sided vs. two-sided rewards
- **Timing** - When to reward referrers (after purchase, after return period, etc.)
- **Promotion Strategy** - Where and how to promote your referral program

### Popular Ecommerce Referral Models

1. **The "Give $X, Get $X" Model**
   - Both referrer and new customer receive a discount or store credit
   - Creates mutual benefit and clear value proposition
   - Easy to communicate and understand

2. **The Percentage Discount Model**
   - Offers percentage discounts instead of fixed amounts
   - Works well for stores with varied price points
   - Can scale with purchase value

3. **The Tiered Rewards Model**
   - Increasing rewards for more successful referrals
   - Gamifies the referral process
   - Incentivizes ongoing participation

## Implementation in RefRef

1. Create a new project using the Ecommerce template
2. Configure your reward structure and tracking parameters
3. Set up custom referral pages and emails
4. Integrate with your ecommerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
5. Implement post-purchase referral touchpoints
