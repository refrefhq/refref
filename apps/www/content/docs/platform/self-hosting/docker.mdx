# Docker Deployment for RefRef

Docker provides the simplest way to deploy RefRef on your infrastructure. This guide walks you through the process of setting up RefRef using Docker containers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Docker 20.10+ installed on your host system
- Docker Compose for multi-container deployment
- At least 2GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores available
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get RefRef running is using our official Docker images:

```bash
# Pull the latest RefRef image
docker pull refref/refref:latest

# Create a docker-compose.yml file with the necessary configuration
# Start the containers
docker-compose up -d
```

## Sample Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  refref:
    image: refref/refref:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/refref
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      # Add other environment variables as needed
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=refref

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  redis_data:
```

## Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider these additional steps:

1. **Use Specific Versions**: Pin to specific image versions rather than using `latest`
2. **External Database**: Consider using a managed PostgreSQL service for better reliability
3. **Persistent Storage**: Configure proper volume mounts for data persistence
4. **Networking**: Set up proper network isolation
5. **Monitoring**: Add container monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
6. **Backups**: Implement regular database backups

## Upgrading

To upgrade your Docker-based RefRef deployment:

```bash
# Pull the latest image (or specific version)
docker pull refref/refref:latest

# Restart your containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

Always back up your data before upgrading.

## Troubleshooting Docker Deployments

Common issues with Docker deployments:

- **Container fails to start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs refref`
- **Database connection issues**: Verify network connectivity between containers
- **Performance problems**: Check resource allocation and container limits
